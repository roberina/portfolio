        Over the past year, my journey into the realm of web development has been greatly influenced by my studies at Kuressaare Ametikool. Through the structured curriculum and hands-on learning experiences provided by the school, I've been able to immerse myself in the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Starting from scratch, I embarked on a journey of discovery, guided by knowledgeable instructors who equipped me with the foundational knowledge of web development. From understanding the structure and semantics of HTML to mastering the intricacies of CSS for styling and layout, my time at Kuressaare Ametikool has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of these essential web technologies. While my education has given me a solid grasp of the basics, I recognize that there's still much to explore and learn. I may not yet be familiar with the advanced technical nuances of HTML and CSS, but my passion for the craft fuels my desire to continue growing and evolving as a web developer. What sets my journey apart is not just the technical knowledge I've gained, but the supportive learning environment fostered by Kuressaare Ametikool. Surrounded by peers who share my enthusiasm for web development, I've been able to collaborate, exchange ideas, and tackle challenges together, enriching my learning experience in the process.

            From the innovation project, I realized how important teamwork really is. If someone from the team does not contribute enough or if someone is absent from the team, all the work can go to waste. In a team, communication must always work, each member must have a task that he must do to the best of his ability.</div>
